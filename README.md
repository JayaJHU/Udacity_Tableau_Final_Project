Udacity Tableau  Final Project

Baseball Analysis

I analyzed 1,157 baseball players from a baseball dataset, which include information on players' height,
weight, hand habits(right hand, left hand and both hands), batting average score and home run score.
I wanted to see how handedness, weight, height and batting average affects the home run performance of the 
baseball players.  This explanatory data visualization attempts to highlight the relationship of baseball players' hand habits, weight, height, batting average against home run performance scores.
